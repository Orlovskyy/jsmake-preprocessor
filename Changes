	  - added support for NAME_ANON vars. 
	  Allow to name anonymous functions. Useful for debugging purpose.
	  Anonymous functions name will be prefixed by $_ in order to be used 
      in conjunction with TRUE_ANON.
      Functions set to a variable or an object property will contain the name used 
      before the assignment operator (:/=) followed by an incremental number.
      Otherwise will be named $_anon followed by an incremental number.

	  - erased the logic to connect to closure compiler. 
	  jsmake now relies solely on perl modules available via CPAN for compression.

	  JavaScript::Mini,JavaScript::Packer or Javascript::Closure.
